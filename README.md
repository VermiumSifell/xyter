## Overview

Xyter is a privacy-focused bot that allows server owners to enable or disable features as per their preference. We prioritize open-source code and do not aim to monetize it. However, we accept donations to improve Xyter. You can either self-host the bot or use our cloud instance. We provide support for both options.

To install Xyter, follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section. The bot is officially supported on Linux. If you need assistance, join our [Discord server](https://discord.zyner.org). Once installed, you can manage settings directly from Discord.

The default set of modules includes but is not limited to:

- Credits (balance, gift, top, work, and administrative commands like give, take, set, transfer)
- Counters (creates channels that allow only specific words, with a cooldown between messages)
- Fun (currently only includes meme)
- Shop (users can purchase custom roles in the server and server hosting via [Controlpanel.gg](https://controlpanel.gg) if enabled by the server)
- Moderation (currently only includes prune command, more commands will be added with improved permission system)
- Reputation (users can give each other anonymous reputation, which is global across all servers connected to the bot instance)

For additional commands, refer to our [Documentation](https://xyter.zyner.org/docs/commands).
